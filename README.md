## Portfolio
Short preview of my work will be available on my website. However, since the website is static it is very restrictive on how much content can be placed directly over there. I will provide short preview of my work under portfolio items and details will be linked to another webpage on my blog post where I will talk about my work in depth.

## Blog
Visit https://spchaurasiya.hashnode.dev/ for latest blog posts by me. I will try my best to link all the latest blogs on my website as well. However, since the website is static, it may not always have most recent blogs.
